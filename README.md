# 4 Day Workout for Ben
---
# GOALS
- THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF LIFTING IS CONSISTENCY. YOUR GOAL IS TO NEVER MISS A DAY.
	- Everything you do needs to be in service of maintaining consistency and getting all 4 work outs a week. Missing a day is not an option.
	- Things that prevent you from getting in the gym:
		- Poor sleep
		- poor recovery
		- poor diet
		- overworking your muscles
		- losing motivation because your workouts are too hard/not fun
	- THEREFORE
		- Get 8+ hrs of sleep a night
		- Take your rest days seriously (walk, get outside, move but don't over exert yourself)
		- Eat protien (1g/lbs of body weight per day) and at least 200-300g of carbs every day + tons of veggies/fiber
		- Drink 1 gal of water each day (add electrolytes or a large pinch of pink salt to each bottle you drink to stay hydrated. You want ~1000mg of additional sodium each day. If salty water tastes good, then you need more salt. If it tastes bad, then youre saturated and can opt for plain water)
		- DONT OVERWORK YOUR MUSCLES. You can always add more next week, you can NEVER undo the work you did last week.
		- Keep your workouts fun. Getting in the gym and doing SOMETHING is more important than having the best workout ever. After a few weeks of doing it, it will become a habit or maybe even enjoyable. Find reasons to look forward to it (I love listening to music, a podcast, audio book, or even watching anime while I work out. Sometimes that's what it takes to make it tolerable when I really don't want to go)
		- Your goal is to build a habit that you never break. This will be one of the strongest commitments you build with yourself or anyone. HAVE A FUCKING REASON WHY. You aren't doing this cause it feels good in the moment (although some day it will). Youre doing this because you want to be healthy long term, you want longevity and big muscles. It's something you NEVER stop doing. So don't think about how you will look in 1 year or 6 weeks. Don't focus on the short term changes, focus on the long-term "why the fuck are you doing this every god damn day" reason. Cause you wanna be healthy, strong, and attractive forever.

# Instructions for first 2-4 weeks
- Pick a weight that you feel activates the target muscle and generates noticeable fatigue, but is not taking your muscles to failure. 
	- You are aiming for a weight where you are only going to be sore for 2-3 days after lifting. If you are sore for 5+ days, that's a good indicator you used too much weight.
	- You may feel silly doing "low weight" compared to others in the gym, but you ARE going to be sore after anything you do regardless. If you are not sore, you did too LITTLE weight.
	- If you feel like you got a good pump, and you are sore for a few days, but not so sore you can't: walk up the stairs, sit on the toilet, lift a drink to your mouth, or sit up out of bed – then you are right in the money.
- How to warm up and find the right weight
	- WU Set 1, 15 reps: Pick a low weight that you can confidently do 30 reps with and is just heavy enough to where you FEEL the muscle working that you are targeting based on the exercise. 
	- WU Set 2, 8 reps: add 5-10 lbs OR 20% more weight. This should be getting heavy, but not quiet enough weight
	- WU Set 3, 4 reps: add another 10-20% of the weight. You should be at your target weight or 5-10% below your target weight. Do 4 reps and ask yourself, how many of these can I do? If your answer is, "no way I can do more than 15" you are in the ballpark. If your answer is, "no way I could do more than 5" that's way too heavy
- STICK TO JUST 2 SETS
	- Can't stress this enough. You may feel like you can do more, but I promise you are going to overwork your muscle and be left miserably sore for over a week and it's going to throw you off your routine (you won't want to OR physically won't be able to get to the gym for the next workout).
	- Do just 2 (or even just ONE set if you realize after the first one that you're gonna hurt tomorrow, lol) and see how you feel the next few days. Then, decide if you want to add more weight/reps/sets and go from there. It's going to take you 6-8 weeks to get to a place where you can lift weight you aren't embarrassed about and can do it for 4 sets of 12 and take your lifts to failure.
	- You are going to feel and see results very quickly in the first 5-7 months, so achieve more with less for now.
	- If you feel like that wasn't enough...
		- try increasing the number of reps the next week (get closer to failure with the same weight) you can do as much as 30 reps on set and it will be just as effective as 6 monster reps.
		- if that's not doing it, then increase the weight (add 5 lbs) and hit the same reps (if you did 12 last week, youre now going for 12 with +5lbs this week)
		- THEN add another set if 2 sets isn't cutting it. You can do a lot in the first 4 weeks by doing just 2 sets and increasing weight and reps

# Instructions for when you feel like you are getting the hang of it (~6 weeks +)
- coming soon...

# RULES
- always maximum intensity, meaning... 
	- slow and controlled on the way up/slow and controlled on the way down
		- don't go in there throwing weight around and trying to muscle-fuck your way through the workout
	- perfect form for EVERY rep
		- search YouTube for good form on each lift if you re unsure
	- taking each set close to failure (0-3 Rps In Reserve)
		- How do you know? If you are going fine and then the next rep becomes either really slow or really heavy or both, you have begun to reach failure. In the early days, do 1-2 more reps past this point if you can do it comfortably, then stop. Later as you are getting in better shape you can take it to true failure where you physically can't finish the last rep with perfect form
- Maintain perfect form in every lift. It's important for maximum results and minimum injury
- Ask for a spot if you need it, everyone is super nice and will happily help
- Don't worry about what you think other people are thinking about you. I promise you all they are thinking about is themselves. They are just happy you are there getting in shape too.
